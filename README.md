A bot user for the Discord Chat application

For now this is just a simple script, but I will likely expand it a bit further.  birbBot.py is the reworked version, victoryBot.py is the old version.

This script requires the use of discord.py as well as SQLite3 


Current functionality:
* add or remove points from users
* issue a "fuck you" to a user
* roll dice using /roll XdY

To install requirements, use `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To do:
* finish up dice rolls for advantage and disadvantage
* re-implement victories as in victoryBot.py
* add error checking
