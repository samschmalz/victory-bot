# victory-bot
A bot user for the Discord Chat application

This is a single-file script for now, but it may be expanded in the future if I look into the Discord API a bit more.  For now, it offers some basic functionality in how it operates.

Current features:
Replies to messages starting with correct commands

To implement:
* given a group of users, will randomly assign a different user to each user (useful for secret santa or other events).
* message a list of commands when a help command is issued
* send a message to another user when the !highfive @user command is issued
